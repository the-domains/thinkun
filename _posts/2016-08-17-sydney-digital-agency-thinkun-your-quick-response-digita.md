      Indeed, it often seems that on Twitter everyone is a marketing expert (or
      has something they want to market or sell). So who can you turn to, or
      follow, on Twitter (and elsewhere) for trustworthy online marketing advice
      that can help you better market your business?

  Storefronts are no longer built with bricks and mortar - they're built with
  ones and zeroes. The percentage of business being transacted online has been
  increasing year after year. This means you're losing more and more potential
  business with each passing day that your business is not online (or that your
  online presence isn't fully optimised).
